# scarf
STATUS: UNFINISHED

The scarf (or Sd card Converter And Real Formatter) program is to convert raw data from an SD card (or another device) to something more appeasable to humans. 

This is written in Cpp to be a bit faster than my previous Python implementation (dawbanc/Raw-SD-Card-to-Spreadsheet).

Once the project hits it's first "working" version, I will post installation instructions here (TODO).
